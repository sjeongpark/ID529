# ID529

This is a repository to collect and arrange practical tips in using R.   
I created this as a took ID529 course in Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.   
ID529 has just launched this year and I highly recommend because it gives a clear outline on the framework and best practices for utilizing R in epidemiologic research!
